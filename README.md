## Getting Started with CUDA-Q.  Here are some resources to get you up to speed with CUDA-Q.  

* If you are new to quantum computing, (e.g., you'd like a review of the definition of a qubit, quantum gates, and quantum circuits), then run through the first two notebooks of the [Quick Start to Quantum Computing](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/quick-start-to-quantum) series.

* If you have quantum computing background and want a quick visual guide for translating a quantum circuit into a CUDA-Q kernel, check out this [hello world visualization tool](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-q-academic/quick-start-to-quantum/interactive_widget/cudaq-hello-world.html).  For more in depth coverage of cuda-q syntax and examples, we recommend notebook 1 of the [QAOA for Max Cut series](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-q-academic/tree/main/qaoa-for-max-cut) series as well as the [examples](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/examples/examples.html) and [applications](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/applications.html) in the CUDA-Q documentation, in particular the [QAOA example](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/applications/python/qaoa.html).  

* If you prefer to learn by watching, you can check out [minutes 30:40-38:28 of this demo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcdc25-dct51159/?playlistId=gtcdc25-quantum-computing-and-hpc&start=1840&end=2308) of description of cudaq kernels, sampling, and getting the state vector or watch [minutes 9:20-19:00 of this demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/DqPC-nlcXKA?si=ualhUnFYjW9BlbQz&t=560).
